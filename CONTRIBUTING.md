## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Enhancements

Bug Reports and Feature Requests are extremely important to a project like this. As it is completely volunteer run, with no leaders, it's important to give people projects they can use to jump right into the code base. When submitting a new issue please take care to -

* make sure it isn't a duplicate, and if you do find an existing ticket please add more detail to that ticket,
* add as much detail as is needed to either replicate the issue or fully build out the new feature.


### Planning Things Out

This is an extremely collaborative project. The larger a feature is the more potential it has for disruption. When planning large features it's important to talk things out in the slack channel or open an Issue on Github to solicit feedback.


### Pull Requests

**Any pull request that gets accepted will be deployed to the screeps server within ten minutes.**

**Do not submit pull requests are are not ready to deploy.**

Please make sure you test all of your changes. This can be done with the in game simulator, a private server, or one of the many public servers available. If you need help please join us in slack for help.

Our styling rules are available in the [.jshintrc](https://github.com/ScreepsQuorum/screeps-quorum/blob/master/.jshintrc) file in the project root. It should get picked up by most IDEs.

Pull requests are accepted by votes, which depend on the [conensus rules](https://github.com/ScreepsQuorum/ScreepsAutoSpawner/blob/master/.gitconsensus.yaml) of the project. You are allowed to vote for your own pull requests.


### Third Party Services

When creating a pull request that provide integration with outside services (continuous integration, code style checks, notifications, stats, etc) make a separate issue description how to integrate with that service so a project curator can provide the necessary infrastructure.
